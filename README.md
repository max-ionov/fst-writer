# FST Writer

This is a small web application providing a rudimentary web interface wrapping [foma](https://fomafst.github.io/).

## Installation

We recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the application to work, `foma` should be installed.

Host, port for the web interface and the path to `foma` can be configured in the file `config.yaml`.

## Running

Since the application is based on Flask, the easiest way to start FST Writer is by running
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python ./fstwriter.py
```

After that, the application should be available at `http://host:port` (default [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)).

## Usage

The application provides two separate areas to write rules and a lexicon. If lexicon area is not empty, it should be combined with the rules like this:
`Lexicon .o. Rule1 .o. Rule2 ...` in the end of the rules section.

An example of rules and a lexicon based on the official `foma` documentation can be found in this repository in the folder `examples/`.

In order to test the rules, put a list of tokens or a text in the corresponding area and press "â†’ Apply". This will tokenise the input and output all the possible analyses for each token.

If you want to save the model, use the button "Save". It will create a file `model.foma` in the working directory of the service which can be used with `foma` outside of the service.
